Veritasium published a video about the 100 prisoners riddle.<br>
I could not stop thinking about it, so I gave it few tries and wrote a python script.<br>
My conclusion: All prisoners are going to die every time!<br>

This is the link to the video.<br>

It's been a while since I wrote code in python. <br>
So I'm sure it could be done easier or better.<br>



<br>
These are my results.<br>
<br>
The lucky prisoner found his number within 50 tries!<br><br>
Number of runs 100<br>
Average number of lucky prisoners 37.73<br>
Highest number of lucky prisoners 55<br>
All Dead<br>
<br><br>

Number of runs 1000<br>
Average number of lucky prisoners 37.304<br>
Highest number of lucky prisoners 60<br>
All Dead<br>
<br><br>
Number of runs 100000<br>
Average number of lucky prisoners 37.50073<br>
Highest number of lucky prisoners 69<br>
again. All dead<br>
<br><br>
Number of runs 1000000<br>
Average number of lucky prisoners 37.496279<br>
Highest number of lucky prisoners 68<br>
again. All prisoners get executed<br><br>
