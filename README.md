Veritasium published a video about the 100 prisoners riddle.
I could not stop thinking about it, so I gave it few tries and wrote a python script.
My conclusion: All prisoners are going to die every time!

This is the link to the video.

It's been a while since I wrot code in python. 
So I'm sure it could be done easyer or better.




These are my results.
